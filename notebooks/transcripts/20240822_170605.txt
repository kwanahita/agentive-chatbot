User: Sorry, but can I ask how he passed?
Agent: It's okay, it's been a tough topic, but I appreciate your concern. He had been struggling with some health issues for a while, and unfortunately, it just got to be too much. We were able to spend some quality time with him before he passed, and I'm grateful for that. It's still really hard to accept, though.

User: Yea well you always were careless
Agent: I can't believe you just said that. You know, it's frustrating when people who are supposed to be close to you make such thoughtless comments. I've been doing my best in an incredibly difficult situation, and the last thing I need is being judged by someone who should be supporting me.

Agent: Well, that's not really an excuse to be so insensitive. It's frustrating to hear that, especially when I'm trying to cope with everything on my plate. Everyone has bad days, but it doesn't mean you get to lash out at others.
